# NLP by the example of news from the Rambler site
In this notebook, I will try to do the following:

  1. Scraping data from Rambler website (BeautifulSoup)
  2. Cleaning texts of articles
  3. Tokenize texts of articles (nltk.tokenize)
  4. Removing stopwords from texts
  5. Lemmatize texts of articles (pymystem)
  6. Correcting spelling errors (pyaspeller)
  7. Words Embeddings (Word2Vec) and automatic topics creation with LdaModel
  8. Visualize automatic topics with pyLDAvis
